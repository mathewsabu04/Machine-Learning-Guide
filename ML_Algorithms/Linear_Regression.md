# Linear Regression

**Linear regression** is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). 

**Formula**
                                                          
                                                          
                                                          y = wx + b

y =  predicted value
w = slope (how much y changes with x)
x = input data
b = y intercept
