# Linear Regression

**Linear regression** is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). 

**Formula**
                                                          
                                                          
                                                          y = wx + b

y =  predicted value

w = slope (how much y changes with x)

x = input data

b = y intercept

# Multiple Linear Regression

Now this formula only works if there is only 1 input. What happens if we have mulitple features? 


In that case, we use this formula: 


                                                y = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + ... + wnxn + b
