# Supervised
Supervised Learning is when our model is being trained on label data. Know what is label data? Label data is when the dataset we have has target values. The point of target values is so that our model can compare its prediction to the actual value. This is great for the model to learn and correct its own mistakes. Some algorithms for supervised learning are:

- [Linear Regression](Linear_Regression.md)
- [Logistic Regression](Logistic_Regression.md)
- [Decision Trees](Decision_Tree.md)
- Random Forest
- SVM
- KNN
