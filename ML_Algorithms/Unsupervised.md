# Unsupervised

Unsupervised learning is when the model is NOT being trained on label data. This means the dataset the model is dealing with does not have target values. What the model tries to do is find patterns byt clustering data, reducing dimensionality, and decting anomalies.
Some algorithms that are used in unsupervised learning are: 

- K - Means
- PCA
- SVD
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
