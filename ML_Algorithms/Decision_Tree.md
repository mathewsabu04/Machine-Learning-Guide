# Decision Trees 

**Decision Trees** are Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. In this file, we will only be talking about the classification aspect of it. A decision tree is made up of these concepts:

**Root Node**: The starting point (entire dataset).

**Internal Nodes**: Decision points based on feature values (e.g., “Is age > 30?”).

**Branches**: Outcomes of decisions (yes/no or categorical splits).

**Leaf Nodes**: Final outcomes or predictions (e.g., class labels or numerical values).

Here is a visual representation of a decision tree:
